Tuesdays, 7 - 8:50pm // C108  
Instructor: Stephanie Smith // scsmith@calarts.edu  

How can computation be reconsidered within the critical contexts of an art practice? Students will be introduced to the aesthetic possibilities of combining art making, computer programming and digital technology. The classes will explore the fundamentals of programming in a variety of IDEs combined with the investigation of physical media, installation and interactive design. The class assignments will lead to a focus on the expressive capabilities of the human body in a sensor-based environment. The core concepts will involve a dialogue between physical action and digital information. A final group project will implement the body, sensors, and microcontrollers using computer programs written in class.

## Shared Code/Assignments

Google Drive where you can upload your code:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vMucFCi4nhILJDcJugT7xk998hOX3EI5?usp=sharing

If you're comfortable with GitHub, add your code as repositories (contact me for access):
https://github.com/comprecon18/

I'd encourage you to share your code so your classmastes can take a closer look. Sharing and building off existing code is a great way to learn and develop new ideas.
